# Human Activity Recogniser (HAR)
HAR is a kaggle competition and I am publishing my 2 solutions to it.
In this competition your goal is to build a Human Activity Recognizer (HAR) based on features captured from mobile phone's accelerometer and gyroscope:

    walking
    walking upstairs
    walking downstairs
    sitting
    standing
    laying
## The evaluation metric is a basic categorisation accuracy. The submission csv file needs to have the following format:
    id,y
    0,1
    1,6
    2,6
